Description of the Project:
      
       The Mern web application being developed for the Onetel mobile shop is aimed at streamlining 
       their work processes and making them more efficient. The Mern stack, which stands for 
       MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, will be utilized to create a user-friendly and scalable 
       application. The application will allow the management to store and retrieve information about 
       customers, suppliers, goods, and sales/purchases with ease.
       
       The system will also automate manual calculations for financial management and generate reports 
       and bills. The database application will be stored effectively on the computer, ensuring data 
       security and accessibility. Furthermore, customers will be able to purchase items online through 
       the system, eliminating the need for physical interaction and providing a more convenient 
       experience.
       
       The Mern web application will bring a new level of organization and efficiency to the Onetel 
       mobile shop, allowing the management to focus on growing their business rather than dealing 
       with manual processes. The user-friendly interface and the ability to store large amounts of data 
       will be valuable assets for the administrator to make informed decisions
